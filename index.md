## [Gunner, HEAT, PC! (GHPC)](https://gunnerheatpc.com/ "https://gunnerheatpc.com/")
*Tank combat simulation game, a cross between accessible arcade & military simulation. Translates to the crew command  "Gunner, use High Explosive Anti Tank ammunition on enemy Personnel Carrier!" (yes, its nerdy)*

### Reticle System
Procedural crosshairs integrated with the ballistics system, allowing projectile trajectories to change on-the-fly for faster design iteration.
All in-game reticles are based on firsthand sources (often difficult to find).

### Day-Night Cycle
Realtime sky simulation, based on a simplified solar system model.<br>Includes seasonal sun elevation, moon phases, & [earthshine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetshine#/media/File:New_Moon.jpg "real life earthshine (wikipedia)").<br>The moon is also simulated as a light source & brightness is affected by phase.
