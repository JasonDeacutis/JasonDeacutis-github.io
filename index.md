## [Gunner, HEAT, PC! (GHPC)](https://gunnerheatpc.com/)
*Tank combat simulation game, a cross between accessible arcade & military simulation. Translates to the crew command  "Gunner, use High Explosive Anti Tank ammunition on enemy Personnel Carrier!" (yes, its nerdy)*
### Reticle System
Procedural crosshairs linked to the ballistics, allowing projectile trajectories to change for faster iteration time.
Based on firsthand sources.

### Day-Night Cycle
Realtime sun and moon positioning, based on a simplified solar system model.
