# [Inter-Coastal Electronics](https://www.faac.com/inter-coastal/) - MR M240
Prototype Mixed Reality [M240](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M240_machine_gun) trainer using the [HoloLens 2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens) ([IVAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Visual_Augmentation_System) placeholder) & Unity Engine.
Our goal is to perform on-aircraft training for helicopter door gunners, without the hastle of live-fire.
The ACME M240 has simulated safety, trigger, belt reloading, malfunctions, & physical recoil (the firing sound is actually the recoil mechanism).
Optional visual aids: ammo counter, safety, gun faults, ballistic trajectory, impact point (CCIP).

***Disclaimer:*** Recording the HoloLens is hard.
Microsoft's recorder has misleading brightness & contrast, its misaligned, has transparency artifacts, and it's at an agonizing *30fps*.
The best alternative was to tape a phone to the HoloLens, but this distorts the colors.
